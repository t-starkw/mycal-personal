# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a simple calendar web application that allows users to stay organized during the work day by providing an interactive space to store meetings and events for each hour of the day. 

This daily planner displays color-coded timeblocks for each standard business hour. The timeblock color indicates whether that time block is in the past, present or future. By clicking into the timeblock, a user can enter and dave an event by clicking the timeblock's corresponding 'save' icon. This application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
